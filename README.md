# What was Learned Through This Project?

Even though R is a very popular language for data science, this project was the first time that I created something out of it aside from solving simple linear regressions with it. To add on, this assignment allowed me to learn how to clean data from clunky datasets in R, merge the datasets together, factor in different data points to determine which regression is more valuable then the ones that I was exhibitting.
